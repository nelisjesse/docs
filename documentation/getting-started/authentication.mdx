description: "The ClientBox API relies on API keys to authenticate requests. These keys allow your application to interact securely with our platform without sharing your password."

## Security

Your API keys carry full privileges to your account. Be sure to keep them secure!

- **Do not** share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or front-end applications.
- **Do not** expose keys in browser scripts. All API requests should be made from your own secure server (backend).

## How to Authenticate

The API uses the **Bearer Authentication** scheme. To authenticate a request, you must provide your API key in the `Authorization` header.

## Header Format

All API requests must include the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.Example Usage

## Example Usage

The following examples demonstrate how to set the Authorization header in various environments.

## Failed Authentication

If an API key is missing, malformed, or invalid, the API will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code.

| **Status Code**    | **Meaning**       | **Reason**                                          |
| :----------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`           | **Authenticated** | The API key is valid and the request was processed. |
| `401 Unauthorized` | **Invalid Key**   | The key is missing, incorrect, or has been revoked. |
